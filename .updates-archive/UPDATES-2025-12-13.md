# Future Updates

## Bugs
- When adding a note about a reading, it doesn't actually save
- It gives you an option to start a plan you have already started

## Improvements
- Should let you skip ahead to the next reading week if you want to read more than one passage a day
- Should let you look ahead in the plan
- Should be able to look at past readings to view progress and notes
- Add daily notifications
- Add custom plans (pick what you want to read each day)
- Make it more obvious for how a user can check off that they completed the reading today

## General Notes
- Use a more modern theme
